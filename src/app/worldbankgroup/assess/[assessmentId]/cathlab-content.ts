## Executive Summary

**Overall Assessment: REQUIRES MAJOR REVISION**

The Technical Evaluation Report contains **8 Critical Issues**, **10 Major Issues**, and **5 Minor Issues** that must be addressed before Bank No-Objection can be granted. While the evaluation demonstrates structured methodology and comprehensive documentation in certain areas, there are fundamental procedural deficiencies, inconsistent application of qualification criteria, inadequate justification for rejections, missing mandatory documentation, and potential violations of World Bank procurement principles that compromise the integrity of this evaluation.

**Most Serious Concern:** The evaluation appears to apply an undocumented technical score threshold to exclude technically qualified bidders from financial evaluation, which violates the combined 70%/30% evaluation methodology specified in the bidding documents and contradicts World Bank procurement regulations.

## CRITICAL ISSUES (Must Fix Before Approval)

### **CRITICAL ISSUE 1: Application of Undocumented Minimum Technical Score Threshold**

**Pages:** 16-23 (Forms 2 & 3 across all lots)

**Description:** The evaluation systematically excludes bidders from financial evaluation based on technical scores despite those bidders being marked "Substantially Responsive" and passing all qualification criteria. This violates the specified combined evaluation methodology.

**Specific Examples with Page References:**

**LOT 1 (Page 16-20):**
- PT Rajawali Nusindo: Score 89/127, "Substantially Responsive," QUALIFIED on Form 11A (Pages 67-90) → **Excluded from financial evaluation**
- Justification: "Not to be invited for the opening of financial part of the bid because not meet in the technical and qualification evaluation"

**LOT 2 (Pages 17-28):**
- PT Surgika Alkesindo JV Neusoft: Score 110/126 → Status unclear, appears excluded despite high score
- Consortium of Siemens: Score 61/126 → Invited to financial evaluation

**LOT 3 (Page 20-21):**
- Beijing PRD International: Score 100/126, "Substantially Responsive," QUALIFIED (Pages 82-86) → Status unclear

**LOT 4 (Page 22-23):**
- PT Tawada Healthcare: Score 68/132, "Substantially Responsive," QUALIFIED → **Excluded**
- Canon Medical Systems: Score 75/132, "Substantially Responsive," QUALIFIED → **Excluded**
- PT Fokus Diagnostic Indonesia: Score 65/132 → **Excluded**
- Yet Consortium of Siemens with score 61/126 in LOT 1 **was invited** to financial evaluation

**Rules Violated:**
- **PR2025 Section V Para 5.50 & Annex X Para 3.1:** When Rated Criteria methodology used, all qualified and responsive bidders proceed to combined technical/financial evaluation
- **PR2025 Annex X Para 2.2a:** "Evaluation criteria and methodology must be specified in detail in Request for Bids documents"
- **PR2025 Annex X Para 2.2c:** "Only evaluation criteria indicated in procurement documents shall be applied"
- **Cathlab Rules C46 (page 60 of bidding documents):** Evaluated Bid Score formula requires BOTH technical AND financial scores: **B = (Clow/C × 0.70 × 100) + (T/Tmax × 0.30 × 100)**

**Critical Analysis:**
The bidding documents specify a combined evaluation methodology with **70% weight for financial** and **30% weight for technical**. This means a bidder with lower technical score but competitive financial offer could rank as Most Advantageous Bid. By excluding bidders before financial evaluation, the committee is:
1. Preventing lower technical scorers from competing on price
2. Applying an evaluation methodology NOT specified in bidding documents
3. Potentially eliminating the actual "Most Advantageous Bid"

**Required Actions:**
1. Provide exact citation from Section III of bidding documents specifying minimum technical score threshold (if it exists)
2. If NO minimum threshold was specified, ALL technically qualified and responsive bidders MUST proceed to financial evaluation
3. Apply the full combined evaluation formula: B = (Clow/C × 0.70 × 100) + (T/Tmax × 0.30 × 100) to determine Most Advantageous Bid
4. Reconsider LOT 4 particularly: excluding bidders with scores of 65, 68, and 75 when their financial competitiveness is unknown violates competitive principles
5. Document the legal/procedural basis for any exclusion before financial evaluation

### **CRITICAL ISSUE 2: Inconsistent and Inadequate Rejection Justifications - "Manufacturing Experience"**

**Pages:** 24-39 (Form 3 - Summary of Bids/Proposals Rejected across all lots)

**Description:** Multiple bidders across three lots rejected for allegedly not meeting manufacturing experience qualification based on interpretation that "Mobile C produced is not a Cathlab," yet this interpretation lacks:
- Citation to exact requirement specification from bidding documents
- Evidence of clarification process
- Consistent application across all bidders

**Affected Bidders and Page References:**

**LOT 1 (Pages 24-31):**
- Shanghai United Imaging Healthcare (Page 24-25, items 1-3):
  - Reason 2: "Not Meet Qualification, manufacturing experience is not in accordance with the requirements (Mobile C produced is not a Cathlab)"
  - Reason listed but unclear if this alone would disqualify

- PT Rajawali Nusindo & EUROCOLUMBUS S.R.L (Page 31):
  - Reason 1: "Not Meet Qualification, manufacturing experience is not in accordance with the requirements, but mobile c-arm is not a Cathlab"

**LOT 2 (Pages 28-30):**
- Similar pattern - multiple bidders rejected with same reasoning

**LOT 3 (Pages 33-35):**
- Shanghai United Imaging Healthcare (Page 33-34):
  - Reason 2: "Not Meet Qualification, manufacturing experience is not in accordance with the requirements (Mobile C produced is not a Cathlab)"

- PT Rajawali Nusindo & Allengers Medical Systems Ltd. (Page 34-35):
  - Reason 1: "Not Meet Qualification, manufacturing experience is not in accordance with the requirements (Mobile C is not a Cathlab)"

**Rules Violated:**
- **PR2025 Annex X Para 2.2e:** "Evaluation criteria must be applied consistently to all Bids"
- **PR2025 Section V Para 5.42-5.44:** Clarification must be sought before rejecting on ambiguous criteria
- **Cathlab Rules A6 (Section III page 53):** Requirement states "manufactured cathlab equipment for at least four (4) years" - Does NOT explicitly exclude manufacturers of related medical imaging equipment
- **EVAL2024 Form 3 Requirements:** Must provide clear "Requirement not met" with detailed "Justification"

**Critical Analysis:**
The Form 11A qualification evaluations (Pages 67-160) show bidders who PASSED this same criterion. For example:
- **Page 67-80:** Multiple bidders show "Complies QUALIFIED" for manufacturing experience
- Yet Form 3 shows others rejected for same criterion

**Questions Requiring Answers:**
1. Where in Section III does it explicitly state that Mobile C-arm equipment manufacturing does NOT qualify as cathlab manufacturing experience?
2. Were clarifications issued to bidders asking them to explain how their manufacturing experience relates to cathlab equipment?
3. Why were some bidders with similar equipment manufacturing backgrounds accepted while others rejected?
4. Does the equipment specification define "cathlab" narrowly enough to exclude angiography C-arms?

**Required Actions:**
1. Provide exact text from Section III, page 53-54 defining "cathlab equipment" manufacturing requirement
2. Document clarification requests sent to affected bidders asking for explanation of manufacturing experience relevance
3. Show bidder responses to clarifications and evaluation committee's assessment
4. Demonstrate consistent application: if one bidder's Mobile C-arm experience was accepted, explain why others' was rejected
5. If criteria was ambiguous in bidding documents, rejection without clarification violates WB procedures

## OVERALL RECOMMENDATION: **REQUEST MAJOR REVISION**

**The evaluation cannot proceed to Bank No-Objection for financial envelope opening until Critical Issues 1-8 are satisfactorily resolved.**

### **Immediate Actions Required (Before Financial Envelope Opening):**

**1. Technical Score Threshold Clarification (CRITICAL ISSUE 1):**
- Provide exact citation from Section III specifying minimum technical score for financial evaluation
- If NO threshold specified, ALL qualified/responsive bidders must proceed to financial evaluation
- Apply full combined formula to determine Most Advantageous Bid

**2. Manufacturing Experience Criteria Documentation (CRITICAL ISSUE 2):**
- Define "cathlab equipment manufacturing" in bidding documents
- Document whether Mobile C-arm manufacturing was explicitly excluded
- Show clarification process with affected bidders
- Demonstrate consistent application across all bidders

**CONCLUSION:** While the evaluation demonstrates structured approach and comprehensive documentation in many areas, the eight critical issues identified—particularly the apparent application of an undocumented technical score threshold and inadequately justified rejections—prevent Bank No-Objection at this stage. Resolution of these issues is essential to ensure fair competition, compliance with World Bank procurement regulations, and achievement of value for money.

**Once critical issues are resolved and adequate documentation provided, the evaluation may proceed to financial evaluation stage with Bank No-Objection.**`;
