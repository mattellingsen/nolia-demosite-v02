# Investigation Report: Stuck Fund Processing Issue

## Executive Summary

Fund ID `a0540d5e-b8df-4d44-83cc-0009a752028d` (Student Experience Grant 07) has been stuck in `PROCESSING` status for over 5 hours. The background job successfully processed 1 of 15 documents (the APPLICATION_FORM) but silently failed when attempting to process the first SELECTION_CRITERIA document, leaving the job in an incomplete state without proper error handling.

## Investigation Findings

### 1. Current State
- **Fund Name:** Student Experience Grant 07
- **Fund Status:** DRAFT (should be ACTIVE after processing)
- **Job ID:** 210b6560-e733-44a2-8671-7a3696aa6586
- **Job Status:** PROCESSING (stuck)
- **Progress:** 1/15 documents (7%)
- **Last Activity:** 2025-09-25T03:01:51.827Z (over 5 hours ago)

### 2. Processing Timeline
1. **14:57:10** - Job created and started processing
2. **15:01:51** - Successfully processed APPLICATION_FORM document
3. **15:01:51** - Attempted to process first SELECTION_CRITERIA document
4. **Silent Failure** - Process crashed/terminated without recording error
5. **Current** - Job remains stuck in PROCESSING state

### 3. Documents Status

#### Successfully Processed (1):
- ✅ `Student Experience Grant - Application Template.docx` (APPLICATION_FORM)
  - Analysis stored in `applicationFormAnalysis` field
  - Claude AI analysis completed successfully

#### Failed On (Document #2):
- ❌ `Student Experience Grant - FCM Operations Template May2024.docx` (SELECTION_CRITERIA)
  - File size: 34,848 bytes
  - First of 9 SELECTION_CRITERIA documents
  - Processing never completed

#### Unprocessed (13):
- 8 more SELECTION_CRITERIA documents
- 4 GOOD_EXAMPLES documents
- 1 OUTPUT_TEMPLATES document

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Failure Point
The job failed while processing the first SELECTION_CRITERIA document at line 426 in `/api/jobs/process/route.ts`:

```typescript
analysisResult = await BackgroundJobService.analyzeSelectionCriteriaDocument(combinedText, document.filename);
```

### Why It Failed Silently

1. **Unhandled Promise Rejection**: The Claude API call in `BackgroundJobService.analyzeSelectionCriteriaDocument()` likely crashed or timed out
2. **Process Termination**: The Node.js process terminated before the error could be caught
3. **No Error Recording**: The `catch` block at line 429 never executed, so `markJobFailed()` was never called

### Contributing Factors

1. **No Timeout Configuration**: The API calls to Claude have no explicit timeout settings
2. **Large Payload**: Selection criteria processing attempts to combine multiple documents into one request
3. **Missing Process-Level Error Handling**: No global unhandled rejection handler to catch these failures

## Evidence Supporting This Diagnosis

1. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - Job processed exactly 1 document then stopped
   - The failed document is the first SELECTION_CRITERIA type
   - No error message recorded in the database

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - Error handling exists but wasn't triggered
   - The failure occurred within an async operation
   - Process likely crashed before catch block could execute

3. **Comparison with Successful Funds**:
   - Other funds (SEG 01, 02, 03) completed all 15 documents
   - This is the first fund to fail at this specific point

## Technical Details

### Failed Code Path
```
1. processDocumentAnalysisJob() starts
2. Processes APPLICATION_FORM successfully
3. Calls processDocument() for SELECTION_CRITERIA
4. extractTextFromFile() succeeds
5. BackgroundJobService.analyzeSelectionCriteriaDocument() called
6. claudeService.executeTask() likely times out or crashes
7. Process terminates before error handling
8. Job remains in PROCESSING state
```

### Missing Error Handling
The process crashed between these two points:
- **Start**: Line 426 - Claude analysis begins
- **End**: Line 429 - Catch block should execute
- **Result**: Neither success nor error path executed

## Recommendations

### Immediate Fix
1. Manually retry the job using the background processor
2. Or reset the job to FAILED status and create a new one

### Code Improvements Needed
1. **Add Timeout Configuration**:
   - Set explicit timeouts for Claude API calls
   - Implement request timeout handling

2. **Improve Error Handling**:
   - Add process-level unhandled rejection handlers
   - Wrap critical async operations in additional try-catch blocks
   - Log before and after each critical operation

3. **Add Recovery Mechanisms**:
   - Implement automatic job recovery for stuck jobs
   - Add health checks for long-running operations
   - Set maximum processing time limits

4. **Monitoring Improvements**:
   - Add detailed logging for each document processing step
   - Implement telemetry for API call durations
   - Alert on jobs stuck for >10 minutes

## Manual Recovery Command

To manually retry the stuck job:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/jobs/process \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jobId": "210b6560-e733-44a2-8671-7a3696aa6586", "retry": true}'
```

## Conclusion

The fund processing failed due to an unhandled error during Claude API analysis of the first SELECTION_CRITERIA document. The process crashed or terminated unexpectedly, leaving the job in a PROCESSING state without proper error recording. This is a critical issue in the error handling flow that needs to be addressed to prevent future occurrences.
