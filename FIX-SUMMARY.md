# AWS Credential Fix Summary - PENDING 0% Issue RESOLVED

## Problem Symptoms
- Fund/Base creation stuck at "PENDING - Waiting to start... 0%"
- Files uploaded to S3 successfully
- Background jobs created in database
- NO SQS messages sent (queue empty)
- Jobs never progressed beyond PENDING status

## Root Cause
**fromInstanceMetadata() was the WRONG credential provider for Lambda environment**

### The Chain of Failures
1. **Amplify Pollution:** Build process sets expired AWS credentials in environment variables
2. **Wrong Provider:** `fromInstanceMetadata()` is for EC2 instances, NOT Lambda functions
3. **Timeout Too Short:** 1000ms timeout insufficient for metadata service in cold starts
4. **Silent Failure:** SQS send wrapped in try/catch that logs but doesn't fail transaction
5. **Result:** Jobs created as PENDING but no SQS messages = stuck forever at 0%

## The Fix Applied (Commit: 17db8f9)

### File: `/src/lib/aws-credentials.ts`

```typescript
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {
  // Delete Amplify's expired build credentials
  if (process.env.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID || process.env.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY || process.env.AWS_SESSION_TOKEN) {
    delete process.env.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID;
    delete process.env.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY;
    delete process.env.AWS_SESSION_TOKEN;
    delete process.env.AWS_PROFILE;
  }

  // Return undefined - SDK uses default chain, finds Lambda role correctly
  return undefined;
}
```

## Why This Works

### Lambda Credential Resolution
- Lambda functions use **container metadata service** (NOT instance metadata)
- SDK's default chain knows how to find Lambda execution role
- With env vars deleted, SDK skips to container metadata
- No timeouts, no wrong endpoints, just works

### Previous Failed Attempts
1. **Lazy initialization:** Didn't fix the core credential problem
2. **fromInstanceMetadata():** Wrong service for Lambda, timeout too short
3. **Delete env vars only:** Worked but was reverted for wrong solution
4. **fromNodeProviderChain():** Would work but unnecessary complexity

## Verification Steps

1. **Check Deployment:** Wait for Amplify to deploy (5-10 minutes)
2. **Test Creation:** Create new fund/base with documents
3. **Monitor Progress:** Should progress past 0% within 30 seconds
4. **Check Logs:** Look for "Environment cleaned - SDK will now use Lambda execution role"

## Key Insights

### AWS SDK v3 Credential Chain Order
1. Environment variables (FIRST - this was the problem)
2. Shared credentials file
3. ECS container metadata
4. EC2 instance metadata
5. Other providers...

### Amplify Lambda Environment
- Runs as Lambda functions behind CloudFront
- Has IAM execution role attached
- Uses container metadata service (NOT EC2 metadata)
- Build process pollutes env vars with expired credentials

### The Simple Solution
Delete the bad env vars, let SDK do its job. No fancy providers needed.
